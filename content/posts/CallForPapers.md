# Technical description {#technical-description}
Machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly popular in the field of networking. It offers promising solutions for network optimization, security, and management. However, the lack of transparency and interpretability in machine learning models poses challenges for understanding and trusting their decisions in critical networking scenarios. Moreover, ensuring safety and reliability is of utmost importance when deploying machine learning in real-world network environments.

Control and decision-making algorithms are critical for the operation of networks, hence we believe that the solutions should be safety bounded and interpretable. Understanding the decisions and behaviors of machine learning models is crucial for optimizing network performance, enhancing security, and ensuring reliable network operations. This is a very crucial topic which needs to be addressed, as network operators, managers or administrators are reluctant to use ML in production networks because of their critical and sensitive nature, e.g., as outages and performance degradations can be very costly.

We invite original research contributions as well as position papers addressing, but not limited to, the following topics:

## Submission procedure

Authors are invited to submit original papers in PDF format, following the ACM conference style (double-column, 10pt font). Papers should be submitted via the hotcrp.com submission System, with a maximum length of 6 pages plus 1 page for references, including figures and tables.

All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous peer-review process by the program committee. Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published in the companion proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register and present the work at the workshop.
