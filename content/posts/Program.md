 #### The Quest for Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning-driven Network Slicing: Progress, Pitfalls and Potential
 The quest for the efficient and autonomous placement of network services is crucial to progressing towards a fully
automated network, commonly referred to as a "zero-touch network". In this presentation, we focus on the results of our
research into exploiting the potential of deep reinforcement learning strategies in the field of network slicing. Our aim is not
only to elucidate the remarkable advantages these techniques offer over conventional methods but also to address their
inherent limitations. In addition, we will highlight new avenues that we are currently exploring to enhance the reliability
aspects of network slicing when deploying techniques based on deep reinforcement learning. During this presentation, we will
outline some of the solutions and tangible results we have obtained in the pursuit of this critical mission.
