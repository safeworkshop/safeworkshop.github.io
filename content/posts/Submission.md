# Submission Procedure

Papers should be submitted via [conext23-safe.hotcrp.com](https://conext23-safe.hotcrp.com) submission System.

All submitted papers will be assessed through a **double-blind review process.** This means that the authors do not see who are the reviewers and the reviewers do not see who are the authors.

As an author, please ensure that your paper submission does not directly or indirectly reveal the authors’ identities. Please find the requirements for a double-blind submission:

- Remove all personal information about the authors from the paper (e.g., names, affiliations).
  
- Remove acknowledgements to organizations and/or people.

- Referring to your previous work should be done similarly to any other work, as if your are not an author of that work.

- Do not add references to external repositories or technical reports that can be used to identify any of the authors or institutions/organization.

- Uploading a version of the paper to a non-peer-reviewed location (e.g., ArXiv) is acceptable. However, authors need to avoid advertising the paper on popular mailing list and social media until after the review process closes.

Submissions should be 6 pages maximum, plus one page for references, in 2-column 10pt ACM format. When using Latex, please download the style and templates from [here](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip).

Uncompress the zip file and look for sample-sigconf.tex in the /sample subdirectory. The file can be used as a starting point, or the confiation can be copied to your own file if one exists. In any case, your text file should use the following class

\documentclass[10pt,sigconf,letterpaper,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}
We encourage authors to share code/data at either submission time or at the camera ready.

All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous peer-review process by the program committee. 

Please note that *at least one author* of each accepted submission should *attend the workshop*. All workshop participants must pay the appropriate registration fee. The registration of *at least one author* is required for the paper to be included in the *conference proceedings*.
